<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p>I'm from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Finished 12th grade, didn't land a public uni as of now, wasn't super into it anyway. Currently figuring life out and looking for a direction that actually makes sense.</p>
<br>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I build small, focused tools to make my own workflow better. All of my work lives in the open. I contribute where I can to projects and ecosystems I genuinely care about. You can find me on various platforms, usually as <strong>rakhalfps</strong> or <strong>tahfizhabib</strong>.</p>
<br>

<h2>What I Care About</h2>
<p>I prefer software that is small, clearly scoped, and honest about what it does. Tools should be understandable end to end, without hidden complexity or unnecessary abstraction. I value programs that behave predictably, compose well with others, and can be reasoned about by reading the source.</p>

<p>I'm a programmer (competent, still learning), a linux user, and someone who prefers working in scripts and editors. Most of my time is spent customizing systems. After years of experimenting with distributions, shells, and environments, I'm moving toward building a stable personal system that I understand end to end.</p>
<br>

<h2>More</h2>
<p>I write about topics that interest me on <a href="https://miqimblog.xyz/"><strong>miqimblog</strong></a>, My journey with linux began in early 2022, and now in my early twenties I continue to refine how I interact with computers and systems. I care about making systems simpler, easier to understand, and more useful. While many people my age have started full-time work, I'm still at home navigating my own path through personal and environmental realities. I'm somewhere I often question but ultimately belong to, preparing to begin my undergraduate studies soon.</p>
