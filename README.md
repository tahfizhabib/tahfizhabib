**hey, miqim here ✨**

*Neither a nerd nor a geek, I split time between computers and understanding people. Interested in programming design, kernel enthusiast, non-biology ideas, and Linux tinkering. I enjoy creating calm, low-pressure spaces where people can be themselves. Fascinated by systems, both technical and human, and how they fail, adapt, and recover. Soft and a little unconventional in a harmless way.*
